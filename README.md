    "The goal for our machine learning model is to help us predict the regular season winning percentages for NBA teams. This model could be useful for incomning players deciding where they would like to play, or fans deciding what teams to support. There is a need for this due to the lasting prominence of the sport at a global scale, and the growth it has sseen in fantasy sports and betting environments. \n"

    "We initially wanted to use a regression decision tree machine learning model for our project. However, through our process of curating our dataset from basketball-refence.com, and researching our methodology, we chose to use a linear regression machine learning model instead.\n",
    "Our steps involved importing the CSV file with our dataset, extracting our dependent and independent variables, cleaning up our data, and creating scatter plots to visualize our data.\n",
    "Scatter plots are a good visualization method for this project because we are creating a linear regression model that will help us understand what the biggest factors in winning percentages are. This will help us understand which team would be the best to join or support based on where their stats fall.\n",
    "We will also create a scatter plot using the plt.scatter method to make a prediction based on our x-array parameters, and then we will be able to utilize the predicted y-values. This will then allow us to use the visualization method of a histogram where the data generated will be compared to our actual data.\n", 
    "This will be compared to our actual data. this will be beneficial because we will be able to clearly see whether our machine learning model appears to be normally distributed.\n"

    " We have been able to identify the type of machine learning that we wanted to use after a series of observations to our first option. Using the linear regression machine learning model for the data set of analysing the different information to determine which basketball team is more likely to win any of the championships or games that we provide background data for.\n",
    "For the data, we have been able to clean up any of the rows with missing data that encounter our logs and discontinued the correct functionality of the code itself to be able to generate the analysis and data progression with complete success.\n",
    "Scattered plots graphs have been able to be displayed indicating the data and information that has been uploaded to our library in which we obtain the different probabilities that apply to each team or player.\n",
    "With the scattered plots we have been able to display the matrices for each of them and set them visible to match their labels and data corresponding.\n",

    "Simple Linear regression model for each of the 9 independent variables agains the dependent variables that the system will create the stronger linear relationship.\n",
    "Our model uses the linear regression which uses a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear realtionship between a dependent variable such as information from past games and one or more independent features with Offensive plays and overall playoffs from the data making it more updated than the algorithms in the market today."
